Exploring representations for word similarity in Hindi


09-07-2020

* Discussed the paper on Word Similarity Datasets [link](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-0811/) and found that they have probably combined the RG-65 and WordSim Datasets fr Hindi (and perhaps other languages) using a 10 point scale
* Decided to go with the integer and average values of the scale as done in the SemEval [task guidelines](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/similarity-datasets/). 
* Survey will have practice questions and collect demographic info about language background, age, gender
* Will probably need to include both similarity datasets for evaluation

* Todo for this week upto 4th July: translate the RG65 dataset into English
